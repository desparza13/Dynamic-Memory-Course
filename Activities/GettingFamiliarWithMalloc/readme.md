First malloc activities to get familiar with dynamic memory:

memoryDirection.c: 

  -Creates an int pointer to null
  
  -In a loop:
    
    -Reserve a dynamic memory space for 64 ints and save its memory direction in ptr
    
    -Assign 5000 to the 10th position
    
    -Print the initial memory direction in order to analyze its changes
    
    -Repeat the activity this time liberating the memory on each loop iteration
