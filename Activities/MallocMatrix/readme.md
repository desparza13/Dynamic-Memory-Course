First malloc activities done:
  pyramidalMatrix.c: gets a random number (R) and creates a pyramidal matrix with R rows.
  Each row (0<=f<R) has f+1 elements with an f+1 value. 
  
  matrixMultiplication.c: prints (matrix a) x (matrix b) = matrix c with any given n squared size  matrixes a and b initialized with random numbers from 0 to 10.
